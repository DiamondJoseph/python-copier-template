# {{ package_name }}

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <{{repo_url}}>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install {{pypi_name}}`
Documentation   | <{{docs_url}}>
Releases        | <{{repo_url}}/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from {{package_name}} import __version__

print(f"Hello {{package_name}} {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m {{package_name}} --version
```
